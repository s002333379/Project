                               Michelle and Karen are both sisters from Sligo,Ireland. In 2020 after loosing their jobs due to the pandemic,
                               they both decided to take the plunge and set up their own cleaning service.
                                They aimed mostly in the beginning towards front line workers to take away the stress of cleaning their homes on top of their already stressful jobs, from there they have expanded to lots of different people.
                                    It was a big risk but has ended up being a huge success and they now have a growing team.
